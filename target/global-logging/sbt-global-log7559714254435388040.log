[error] Cannot find or construct a Read instance for type:
[error] 
[error]   domain.entity.RegularUser
[error] 
[error] This can happen for a few reasons, but the most common case is that a data
[error] member somewhere within this type doesn't have a Get instance in scope. Here are
[error] some debugging hints:
[error] 
[error] - For Option types, ensure that a Read instance is in scope for the non-Option
[error]   version.
[error] - For types you expect to map to a single column ensure that a Get instance is
[error]   in scope.
[error] - For case classes, HLists, and shapeless records ensure that each element
[error]   has a Read instance in scope.
[error] - Lather, rinse, repeat, recursively until you find the problematic bit.
[error] 
[error] You can check that an instance exists for Read in the REPL or in your code:
[error] 
[error]   scala> Read[Foo]
[error] 
[error] and similarly with Get:
[error] 
[error]   scala> Get[Foo]
[error] 
[error] And find the missing instance and construct it as needed. Refer to Chapter 12
[error] of the book of doobie for more information.
